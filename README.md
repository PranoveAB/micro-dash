# micro-dash

Based on [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash)

Attempt to create a micro version of lodash, leveraging on modern browser capabilities to make it more lightweight. This would also mean lesser/no support for legacy browsers.

Note: This is still work in progress

## Requirements

- Node version >= 10.13.0

  [webpack 5 requires at least Node.js 10.13.0 (LTS)](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/v5.0.0/package.json#L106-L108)
